BetaEx 

BetaEx is an sign up portal for the casual gamer looking to apply to a beta testing program aimed at providing game developers with sufficient testers for the development of their upcoming games. 

Website visitors will get to know the philosophy behind the program as well as being able to apply to the program through our application form. Businesses will be able to gather any contact information necessary in order to join the partner program. 

The aim is to provide the casual gamer with the insight of the development process of games and in return, they will get redeemable game keys for the time they put in. The developer will then get a better understanding of the gamer experience and be able to put that feedback into use before releasing the finished product.
