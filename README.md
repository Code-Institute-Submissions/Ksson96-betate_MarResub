# UX

### Project Goals
The final idea was to create an easy to navigate platform where gamers could apply to be part of a game testing program with a site that gives a clear description of the purpose behind it.

### User Stories
- As a User I want to be able to see what game studios I will be testing games for.
- As a User I want an easy way to find contact details in order to join the program as a game developer.
- As a User I want to quickly be able to navigate to the application form.

### Design Choices

#### Fonts

The fonts used are Abel & Anton. 

Anton was used for the headings since it worked well with single word use as the general thickness was quite high which made it stand out.

Abel however was primarily used for longer paragraphs of text alongisde the navigation menu and the form to keep those areas less cluttered. 

#### Colours

The idea was to make a site that resonates with gamers and therefore the primary colours were white (#fff) text and light green (#07aa0f) borders on a black (#000) background. 
Some darker variations of (#07aa0f) were used for borders in order to create a sense of depth on around some of the sections.

### Future Goals

To create a better sense of community, future goals include creating topics that posts can be categorized into to seperate interests and discussions to the users chosen subjects. And to keep the discussion going, a notification system would help to alert users when a user interracts with their posts.
